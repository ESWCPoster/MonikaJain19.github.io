# <center> Got Covid Shield vaccinated today </center>
<p>
Hi, I was pretty excited because I was about to get shot of <b> covid shield </b> vaccine. This corona is terrible....I wish I havent heard this name before. It created so much chaos in all over world. People lost their lives becasue of this virus, I really don't know who created or where it come from but whoever did done a biggest mistake. 
A smaller protection of corona will relieve me a lot and hence the happiness of vaccine. As per today's scenaio there is shortage of oxygen, medicine and hospital beds.
We should all take care of ourslef and take the vaccine.

  I registered for the vaccine and got slot with lot of difficulty as there are limited seats available as per now. I just followed some telegram links in which seats information where shown, links are given by my college (IIIT-Delhi).
 I went to Gargi School Safdarjung En S3 for the vacccination, after 30 minutes of waiting I got the first shot of vaccine and then the observation time was 30 mins and then they let me go. The shot was not painful and the nurse took only 2 second for the shot.
  Afer reaching home, I was okay just little pain on my hand. But as the time goes, in the night I got 100 degree fever and then i took paracetamol and after 3 hours my fever went off and I was okay.
 Next day a little pain on my hand and after that yuppieeee I am done with my vaccine dose successfully with all sideeffects coverup :)
